# The-energy-spectrum-of-the-kaon-from-Lattice-QCD

This study presents the analysis of data related to the two-point function of kaon generated from lattice QCD simulations. Using gauge configurations of twisted-mass fermions, we obtain the correlation functions for 6 values of momentum for the kaon between 0 and 2 GeV (both inclusive), we use statistical techniques such as jackknife resampling to derive the energy of the particle. The lattice results are compared to the continuum dispersion relation for the particle, to assess systematic uncertainties in the lattice data. We establish consistency with theory by comparing our results with the theoretical predictions.
